# pyvvt
Python-based Virtual Tabletop Tool


# Planned features/fixes
- Updated tokens are drawn on-top (requires action-timestamp in database, sorting tokens client-sided)
- flipping tokens (maybe using buttons?)
- re-enable mouse wheel action (token needs to be stored to ignore rotation/size update for the next couple of ms, to avoid fucking up client-side-prediction)
