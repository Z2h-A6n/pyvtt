# pyvvt
Python-based Virtual Tabletop Tool

## What is this?

This piece of software is the engine behind the [Index Card Virtual Tabletop (ICVTT)](https://icvtt.net). It's mostly designed for playing variations of _Index Card RPG_ (ICRPG) by [Runehammer Games](http://runehammer.online) but can be used with other tabletop games (like _WAR|MAKER_, also by Runehammer Games).

See the wiki for more details.
